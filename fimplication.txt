Coefficient Interpretation
Intercept (658.3300255):

The intercept represents the log-odds of success when all independent variables are zero. A positive intercept suggests a baseline likelihood of success even without any contributions from the other variables.
Revenue from Operations (0):

A coefficient of 0 indicates that revenue from operations does not have a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of IPO success in this model. Changes in this variable do not affect the predicted outcome.
Other Income (0):

Similar to revenue from operations, a coefficient of 0 suggests that other income does not influence the success of the IPO.
Total Revenue (0):

Again, a coefficient of 0 indicates that total revenue does not significantly impact the likelihood of success. This could imply that investors may not prioritize revenue figures when evaluating an IPO.
EBITDA (13826552.1):

A positive coefficient suggests that higher EBITDA is associated with a greater likelihood of IPO success. This indicates that profitability before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization is a strong predictor of success.
EBITDA Margin (%) (107.9552602):

A positive coefficient indicates that a higher EBITDA margin is associated with a greater likelihood of success. This suggests that companies with better operational efficiency are more likely to succeed in their IPOs.
Net Profit after Tax (PAT) (26200061.12):

A positive coefficient implies that a higher net profit after tax increases the odds of IPO success. Strong profitability is a favorable indicator for investors.
Net Profit Margin (%) (23.47512218):

A positive coefficient suggests that a higher net profit margin is associated with a higher likelihood of success. This indicates that companies that retain more profit from their revenues are viewed favorably.
Equity Share Capital (0):

A coefficient of 0 means that equity share capital does not significantly affect the likelihood of IPO success.
Net Worth / Equity (0):

A coefficient of 0 suggests that net worth or equity does not have a meaningful impact on IPO success.
Earnings Per Share (0):

A coefficient of 0 indicates that earnings per share do not significantly influence IPO success.
Return on Net Worth (%) (0):

A coefficient of 0 implies that return on net worth does not significantly impact the likelihood of success.
Debt to Equity Ratio (0):

A coefficient of 0 suggests that the debt to equity ratio does not significantly influence IPO success.
Asset Turnover Ratio (8815.468514):

A positive coefficient indicates that a higher asset turnover ratio is associated with a greater likelihood of success. This suggests that companies that efficiently utilize their assets to generate sales are viewed favorably.
Cash and Bank Balance (0):

A coefficient of 0 implies that the cash and bank balance does not significantly impact IPO success.
Total Assets (0):

A coefficient of 0 indicates that total assets do not significantly influence the likelihood of success.
Current Ratio (1460.641717):

A positive coefficient suggests that a higher current ratio (liquidity measure) is associated with a greater likelihood of IPO success, indicating that companies with better short-term financial health are more likely to succeed.
IPO Size (Fresh Issue) (53687091.2):

A positive coefficient indicates that a larger IPO size is associated with a greater likelihood of success. This suggests that larger offerings may attract more investor interest and confidence.
Summary Implications
Positive Indicators: EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Net Profit after Tax, Net Profit Margin, Asset Turnover Ratio, Current Ratio, and IPO Size are all positively associated with the likelihood of IPO success. Companies that exhibit strong profitability, operational efficiency, liquidity, and larger offerings are more likely to succeed.
Neutral Indicators: Variables like Revenue from Operations, Other Income, Total Revenue, Equity Share Capital, Net Worth, Earnings Per Share, Return on Net Worth, Debt to Equity Ratio, Cash and Bank Balance, and Total Assets do not significantly influence IPO success in this model.
